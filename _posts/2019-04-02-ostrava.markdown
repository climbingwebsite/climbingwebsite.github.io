# Climbing inside a museum, in Ostrava

A place where climbing meets industry and former factories, where today's leisure meets yesterday's labour: welcome to **Ostrava**!

One of Europe's most important **coal-mining and metallurgical** centers in the past, Ostrava is nowadays a cultural center, home to two universities, a big music festival - **Colors of Ostrava** and **climbing**... inside a museum!

_The Mining Museum in Ostrava_

Located in the Czech Republic - the paradise of sandstone climbing - Ostrava hosts an indoor climbing gym, inside its most famous museum: **The Mining Museum**. 

Entering the former coal mine, the climber inside each one of us will be amazed by the impressive steel structures that were once filled with tons burning-hot charcoal. Today, people just walk around, drinking a coffee in the thematic cafes, exploring the mine or... doing some climbing.
