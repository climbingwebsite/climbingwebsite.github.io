# Indoor climbing in Prague

_Having such a strong climbing tradition and impressive sandstone valleys all over the country, the Czechs had to make sure they won't miss out during the work week or on long rainy days. As a result, they have plenty of awesome **indoor climbing** halls: one better than the other!_ 

_Moreover, keeping up with the high demand, the routes get changed very often: there is just no time to get bored in **Prague**!_
